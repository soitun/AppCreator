# AppCreator
Drag and drop hybrid app creator you can add to your Cordova/Phonegap project.

# Work in Progress!!!
This project aims to create an easy to use program to create the www folder needed on Cordova/Phonegap projects.

The interface will be a drag and drop grid that creates a json archive (or multiple, haven't decided yet) which would be used on a php
script to generate the files needed for the app.

The project also aims to create a backend where you can edit your app on the fly and be able to edit multiple of these apps by
multiple users.
